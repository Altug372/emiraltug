                <p>Why are schools failing girls in tech careers?
                    
                    There are many reasons why girls are failing in tech careers. 
                    
                    Here are some of these reasons:
                    <br><br>
                    1.Gender discrimination: As the majority of those working in tech are male, some female students may experience gender discrimination. This can reduce girls' confidence in technology, which can negatively affect their success.
                    <br><br>
                    2.Lack of role models: Successful women in technology can be role models for young girls. However, the lack of these role models can discourage girls from pursuing technology careers.
                    <br><br>
                    3.Access to educational opportunities: In some schools, girls may have fewer opportunities for technology education than boys. This can lead to girls' underachievement in technology careers.
                    <br><br>
                    4.Prejudices: Some teachers may have preconceptions that girls will fail in subjects such as math and science. These prejudices can cause girls to fail in technology careers.
                    <br><br>
                    5.Lack of emotional and social support: Girls may lack emotional and social support if they do not have a family member or friend who works in technology. Lack of these supports can lead to the failure of female students in technology careers.</p><br><br>
